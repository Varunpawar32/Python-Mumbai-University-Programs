#Function
#--> if a group of statement is repeatedly require then it is not recommended to write those statement everytime seperately.
#we have to define those statement as single unit and we can call that unit any number of times based on the requirement without rewriting
#this  unit is called as funtion.
#the main advantages of funtion is code reusability
